StringBuffer
============

StringBuffer objects are mutable, meaning that you can change the contents of the buffer without creating a new object.
The initial capacity of a StringBuffer can be specified when it is created, or it can be set later with the ensureCapacity() method.
The append() method is used to add characters, strings, or other objects to the end of the buffer.
The insert() method is used to insert characters, strings, or other objects at a specified position in the buffer.
The delete() method is used to remove characters from the buffer.
The reverse() method is used to reverse the order of the characters in the buffer.
